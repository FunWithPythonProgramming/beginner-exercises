# Guess The Number

The goal of this exercise is to generate a random number and request that the user guess it. Here are some feature ideas:

* Allow user to pick an upper/lower threshold and select a random number
* Request user to guess within the range
	* Validate user input
* Return back higher/lower to give a hint
* Request to play again
